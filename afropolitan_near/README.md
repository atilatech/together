# AfroShare: Easily Share Your Afropolitan NFTs with Others

[AfroShare](https://near.org/tomiwa1a1.near/widget/AfroShare?alchemyApiKey=uB5QD-LyGRGbOa5--7aWs-dyqxjb3z24&address=0x8842da19ef17d1a10875e0ebddb6981e178b90d2&tokenId=1) is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to share their Afropolitan Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with others.

Consider a token-gated event that requires an Afropolitan NFT. You hold an Afropolitan NFT, but you can't attend the token-gated event. However, you know someone who would love to attend but doesn't hold an Afropolitan NFT. AfroShare comes to the rescue!

- dApp deployed on Near BOS
  - Audit code and ownership signatures
  - Compose and remix additional NFT features
  - Support NFTs on multiple blockchain chains

## How it Works

### 1. Smart Contract
The NFT is stored as a Rentable NFT **ERC-4907 Smart Contract** with:
- Two user roles: Owner and User
- An expiry field that specifies the rental duration

View the [Rentable Afropolitan NFT Smart Contract on Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x8842da19ef17d1a10875e0ebddb6981e178b90d2#code),  [Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/goerli/0x8842da19ef17d1a10875e0ebddb6981e178b90d2/) and [Github](https://github.com/atilatech/together/blob/master/contracts/RentableNFT.sol).

### 2. Near BOS Components
AfroShare is deployed on Near BOS, ensuring the dApp's security and reliability. The dApp is composed of Near BOS components:
- **[AfroShare](https://near.org/tomiwa1a1.near/widget/AfroShare)**: The main application
- **[RentNFT](https://near.org/tomiwa1a1.near/widget/RentNFT)**: Handles the rental of NFTs
- **[TokenGate](https://near.org/tomiwa1a1.near/widget/TokenGate)**: Manages access to token-gated events
- **[TransferNFT](https://near.org/tomiwa1a1.near/widget/TransferNFT)**: Transfer Full ownership of the event

## Benefits
- Users can gain access to token-gated events even if they donâ€™t own the required NFTs
- Owners can rent out their NFTs securely without losing ownership
- Facilitates interaction and collaboration within the Afropolitan community and their friends
